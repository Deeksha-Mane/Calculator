Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript <br>
For my 3rd task, I designed and built a user-friendly and interactive CALCULATOR.This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition,subtraction,multiplication,division and modulo operation as well...
The calculator features an interactive interface, allowing users to easily input numbers and operators.Calculations are performed in real time, providing instant results.This project follows best practices in web development with clean, modular and well-documented code.  
HTML was used for creating the structure of the calculator and it was designed by using CSS.The concepts of CSS Grid were used for creating a responsive and flexible layout.JavaScript was used for implementing the calculator's logic and functionality...<br>
Future Enhancements:<br>  1.Adding more advanced calculations such as trigonometric functions,logarithms,exponential calculations <br>   2.Implementing the history feature in the calculator so that users can view the previous calculations <br>   3.Enhancing the UI: With additional styling and animations to improve user experience
